# List : Mutable syntax:[]
Mutables someting that can be changed is 

Students = ['Ganga', 'Swetha', 'Sreenivasulu', 'Ramanjanamma']
s3_buckets = ['Ganga_bucket', 'Swetha_Dev_Bucket', 'Sreeni_Prod_Bucket']

In list you add the students or buckets to the lists,

When you know the something you can add/remove use the list.

list are hetrogeneous in nature

# Tuple :Immutable syntax:()
But in tuple you can't add the students or remove the students
list of admin count 

Students = ('Ganga', 'Swetha', 'Sreenivasulu', 'Ramanjanamma')

Better memory footprint
